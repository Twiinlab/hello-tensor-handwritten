2. Create a virtualenv environment by issuing a command of one of the following formats:

 $ virtualenv --system-site-packages ~/hello-tensor-handwritten # for Python 2.7

3. Activate the virtualenv environment by issuing one of the following commands:

 $ source ~/hello-tensor-handwritten/bin/activate

4. Ensure pip â‰¥8.1 is installed:
